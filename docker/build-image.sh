# tool.  Generally speaking, it's often sufficient to grab this image
# from Docker Hub rather than building it separately.
#
# To pull from Docker Hub:
#   docker pull sudokar/generator-tf-module:latest
#
# For more about the image on Docker Hub:
#   https://hub.docker.com/r/sudokar/generator-tf-module

# since this is a change from previous behavior (the 'jq' requirement is
# new), make sure to check we can locate the newly required command; if
# not, provide a helpful message (to STDERR) to the user so they can 
# remedy the problem, and then exit with an error code so it's clear
# that the build was not successful.
